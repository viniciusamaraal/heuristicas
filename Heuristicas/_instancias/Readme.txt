Instances description:

 - Small: First line of each file contains the name of the instance. Second line contains the number of vertices and number of edges of the instance. The following lines describe the arcs of the instance indicating the two vertices linked by each arc.

 - Grids: First line of each file contains the name of the instance. The following lines correspond to the adjacency matrix of the instance. The number of rows and columns of that matrix is equal to the number of vertices of the instance. When there is a 1 in a position (x,y) of the matrix it means that there exist an arc between the vertex represented by the column (x) and the vertex represented by the row (y).

 - Harwell-Boeing: First line of each file contains the name of the instance. Second line contains the number of vertices and number of edges of the instance. The following lines describe the arcs of the instance indicating the two vertices linked by each arc.
